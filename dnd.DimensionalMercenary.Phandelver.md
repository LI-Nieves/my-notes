## Characters
- Dungeon Master: Kyle Tuico
- Akta: Kyle Tibayan
- Emerit: Francis
- Gondorf: Hans
- Hildebrand: Michael
- Pieck: Nil
- Shadow: Ethan
- Tim: Lee

## After the dragon slaying...
- Since we slayed the dragon, we were told where Wave Echo cave is
    - *Everyone* now knows where Wave Echo cave is, including Iarno
    - Technically, we don't need to save Gundren anymore, we can just go straight to Wave Echo cave, since our summoner is Korvac

## Connyberry
- Arrive at 20:00 -- it's foggy
- We see the entrance of her home: a hole in a tree with a lantern outside
    - Emerit aggressively rolls a Rock of Yondallah into the opening
    - Akta whispers "Agatha" towards the opening
        - Fog grows colder around us, but no one comes out
    - Emerit throws paper airplane made of Pamphlet of Researchtology through the opening
        - The paper airplane flies in but disappears
- The witch comes out with the paper airplane in her hand then burns it
    - She says: "Who are you?!"
    - Tim greets her politely
    - She ignores Tim and instead floats towards Akta: "Are you a descendant of a Dendrar?"
    - We remember Mirna's last name is Dendrar... Akta says: "We found it in a house."
    - She takes the crown off Akta's head
    - Akta asks for information before letting her keep the crown
    - She says: "I made a pact so that in exchange for the crown, I'll help the Dendrar family as much as I can"
    - We ask her for 6000 GP
    - She says: "Instead, how about I give you information on how you can get that much gold?"
    - Tim says: "Are you talking about Wave Echo cave?"
    - She realizes that we're foreigners and tells us we can't use the money in the cave because we'd need to mine it
- We start asking her about the Black Spider...
- To gain info without giving up the crown, we would need to give her Mirna
- (Curious about how strong she is) She says that she's weaker than Venomfang, she thinks she *may be able to* kill Iarno
- Gondorf gives her a truth serum to drink... She says "Are you sure you wanna waste this on me?", so he puts it back in his bag
- We agree to get Mirna and give it to her so she can break the pact without us having to give her the crown
    - But we have to leave her with Gondorf and the crown
    - Gondorf learns a new spell in the meantime
- We ask her why she wouldn't want to kill Iarno?
    - **She says: "What's the point in killing a puppet?"**
- We bring her Mirna
    - She demands we ask her our question now... We ask: "Tell us everything about the Black Spider?"
        - Neznar
        - He's a drow
        - He leads a band of elves who are seeking to take over Wave Echo cave
    - The witch shrivels up and turns into dust
    - The fog lifts from the forest
    - *Essentially, Agatha was a banshee (already dead) and her pact with the Dendrars were keeping her in this world, so breaking the pact with Mirna allowed her to die*
    - *We get to keep the 5000 GP crown and Mirna, yay :)*

## Return to Phandalen
- Korvac wants to save Gundren, but Sildar doesn't care about him anymore
- We ask: "Korvac, how would you feel if we go straight to Wave Echo cave?"
    - Korvac: "I owe him my life!"
    - Sildar: "You can live your own life now!"
- Tim convinces them to save Gundren by saying Gundren will give them the riches from Wave Echo cave
- We go to see Iarno
    - Thanks us for helping with the dragon, offers us stuff in exchange for our services
    - Offers us gold (1500 each), or new spells, or potions
        - *Hildebrand buys Summon Elemental from me for 100 GP*
- We head to Cragmaw Castle with Sildar

## Cragmaw Castle
- We see muddy footsteps leading up the stairs and through entryway, with dried blood -- looks like someone was dragged
- A drow spots us and tells us to leave, tells us Gundren isn't here
    - We show the drow the Glass Staff, but he doesn't recognize it
- We decide to just go around the building on the south side
- <span style="color:red">We encounter some goblins and fight them</span>
